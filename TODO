NOTE:
Ideally, when 'expect: 100-continue' is sent, the request.body() method will
emit res.writeContinue(), as long as it doesn't throw. Unforunately, this is
handled by http.Server, not the request handler. If a module is created to wrap
around http.Server, is should also handle 'upgrade' events, and the methods that
are expected of http.Server.

NOTE:
During any 'before' or 'after' route handler, the request could actually be
aborted. It's safe to continue processing the request as if it weren't, and the
response will simply be discarded when it would normally be sent to the client.
Also, a river response body is subject to possible cancellation at any time, if
the client aborts the request. This normally doesn't matter unless the river
chain is performing writes as it streams out, or if its rejection handler only
expects server-induced errors.

NOTE:
Any time a Response object is used in an 'after' middleware, it could be a
400-599 error response, which might not be obvious when writing the middleware.
