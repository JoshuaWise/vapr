NOTES:
Ideally, when 'expect: 100-continue' is sent, the request.body() method will
emit res.writeContinue(), as long as it doesn't throw. Unforunately, this is
handled by http.Server, not the request handler. If a module is created to wrap
around http.Server, is should also handle 'upgrade' events, and the methods that
are expected of http.Server.
